# Mini-I18n
Because during the last Unity project I wrote an international component, I want to try to modify it to make it easier to use and more efficient

Current plan
- Support JSON and YAML
- Not only translate the sentence, but also modify the parameters in the sentence
- Solved the font problem when TextMeshPro was used before
