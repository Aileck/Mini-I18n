# Mini-I18n
Because the last Unity project wrote an international widget, I want to try to modify it a little to make it easier to use and more efficient

Current plan
- Support JSON and YAML
- Not only translate the sentence, but also modify the parameters in the sentence
- Solved the font problem when TextMeshPro was used before
